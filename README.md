### Project description 

Birth asphyxia is one of the most prevalent neonatal diseases in the world. It is among the most common mechanisms of death in neonates, causing 23% of all neonatal deaths. While birth asphyxia is preventable with proper identification, diagnosis requires expensive technology or highly trained medical professionals both of which are lacking in remote or rural locations. As a result, it is likely that low-income areas and developing countries have a disproportionate amount of infants suffering from neonatal asphyxia-induced disability and death.

Previous studies have shown that neonatal asphyxia can be assessed using crying sound waves coming from infants, as speech and breathing are controlled both by the lungs. In  machine learning research, many cutting edge techniques have been developed to perform infant cry classification. These methods include using various forms of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the use of SVM or transfer learning from the African startup Ubenwa. A baseline sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 89% was reported in 2018.

In this work, we first plan on replicating the transfer learning model provided by Ubenwa. We then will attempt to improve accuracy by using transformer architectures to advance the state of the art in infant cry detection. If time permits, we will try to perform multi-classification tasks on various diseases shown to be diagnosable by pathological cries instead of binary classification on asphyxia.
